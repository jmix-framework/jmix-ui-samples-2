<p>Any action present in the component implementing <code>HasAction</code> interface, or in the view itself, can
    be assigned to a button.</p>

<p>A button gets values of same-name attributes from an assigned action, if these attributes are not defined in
    the button. In this example, the button takes its text from the action.</p>
