The `dashboard` component has several theme variants:

- `elevated-widgets`
- `flat-widgets`
- `shaded-background`

You can set these styles to the `dashboard` component using the `themeNames` attribute either in the XML descriptor or
in the view controller using constants from `DashboardVariant` class.
