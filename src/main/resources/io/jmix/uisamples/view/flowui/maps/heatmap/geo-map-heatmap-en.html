    The <code>GeoMap</code> component supports heat maps.
</p>
<p>
    A heatmap overlay is intended to display data density distribution across different geo-points. Data density is
    highlighted with color. By default, regions with higher points density are displayed in red and regions with lower
    density - in green.
</p>
<p>
    In this example first heatmap layer gets the data from data container and second heatmap layer gets data
    programmatically in a view controller.
