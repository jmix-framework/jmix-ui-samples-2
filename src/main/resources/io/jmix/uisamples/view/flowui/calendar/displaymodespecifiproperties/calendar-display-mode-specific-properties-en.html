<p>
    Every display mode has specific properties that can be configured within the <code>displayModeProperties</code>
    element.
</p>
<p>
    Also, the <code>FullCalendar</code> component allows you to define properties that are not declared in XML elements.
    These properties override existing configuration from the calendar for a specific display mode. For instance, in
    this sample, the day-grid month display mode sets visible week numbers. Please note that the property name in the
    <code>property</code> tag should be defined as specified in the FullCalendar.js documentation.
