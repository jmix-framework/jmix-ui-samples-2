To configure custom rendering of grid items, `renderer` is used. It can be set using the `setRenderer` method, or the
declarative `@Supply` construct in the view controller.

This sample demonstrates the `renderer` for the `Customer` entity card. The component also supports using [
`fragmentRenderer`]({contextPath}/sample/fragment-renderer).
