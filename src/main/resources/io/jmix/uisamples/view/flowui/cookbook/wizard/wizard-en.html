<p><code>Wizard</code> is a component for step-by-step data filling.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates the <code>wizard</code> for creating the <b>Employee</b> entity (see
    <code>Employee.java</code>).<br/>
    The wizard opens in the dialog by clicking the button and consists of three steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Filling in basic information about the employee</li>
    <li>Filling in the address</li>
    <li>Checking the entered information</li>
</ul>
<p>Each step is associated with data, information about which is stored in the main view <code>WizardDialog</code>.
    The first two steps have fields that will be validated when moving to the next step.</p>
<p>The user can switch between steps at any time (if the data at the current step is correct) using the
    corresponding buttons, which change their behavior and state depending on the current step.</p>
<p>The <code>wizard</code> is based on the <code>tabSheet</code> component. The steps are implemented as separate
    tabs. The content of each tab is implemented as a <code>fragment</code>.</p>
