<p>
    The component will consider an event as recurring, if it has one of the following properties:
    <code>recurringDaysOfWeek</code>, <code>recurringStartDate</code>, <code>recurringEndDate</code>,
    <code>recurringStartTime</code> or <code>recurringEndTime</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that, by default, an event in the data provider is expanded into single events in the calendar. If the
    user changes a recurring event, the change will be applied to the corresponding single event in the data provider.
</p>
<p>
    If a recurring event has a group ID property, all recurring events will be moved or resized together.
