This example demonstrates the ability to customize the `Workbook` for the `Spreadsheet` component.

Various styles, formulas, formats, and conditional formatting are applied to the sheet.
To see the component in action, fill in the fields in the **yellow cells**. Other values be calculated automatically.

The following services were used to implement the sample:

- [SpreadsheetStyler]({currentPath}?tab=SpreadsheetStyler.java) for creating fonts and styles for the Workbook
- [SpreadsheetRangeSupport]({currentPath}?tab=SpreadsheetRangeSupport.java) for working with a range of values
- [SpreadsheetFormulaSupport]({currentPath}?tab=SpreadsheetFormulaSupport.java) for defining formulas
