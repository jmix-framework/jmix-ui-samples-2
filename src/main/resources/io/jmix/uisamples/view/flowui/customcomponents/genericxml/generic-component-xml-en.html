    The <code>component</code> XML element can be used to create any UI component by FQN. In order to define component
    properties the nested <code>property</code> elements can be used. This can be convenient if you connect an addon or
    integrate a JavaScript component. In cases where full integration of a component into the framework is not needed,
    but you just need to support its use in XML.
