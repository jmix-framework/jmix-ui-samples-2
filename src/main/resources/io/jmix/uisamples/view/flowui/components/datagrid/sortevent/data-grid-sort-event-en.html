<p><code>com.vaadin.flow.data.event.SortEvent</code> reacts to changes in column sorting.
    The sample above shows the current sort order for each column as it changes. To add custom behavior — such as
    triggering other updates on the view — add your own logic accessing the order via <code>even.getSortOrder()</code>.
