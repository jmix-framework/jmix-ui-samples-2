<p>
    The <code>CallbackCalendarDataProvider</code> loads data only when the component needs new events. The calendar
    requires new data in the following cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When the user switches to a calendar display mode that has a wider date range than the previous one.
    </li>
    <li>
        When FullCalendar's navigation methods are invoked (e.g. <code>#navigateToNext()</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
        When the time zone of the component is changed.
    </li>
</ul>
