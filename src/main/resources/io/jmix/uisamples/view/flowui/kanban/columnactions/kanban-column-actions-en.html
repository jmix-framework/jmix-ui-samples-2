<p>The <b>Kanban</b> board component supports changing column settings dynamically. To control this feature, use the
    <code>collapsible</code>, <code>columnReorderingAllowed</code> and <code>columnActionsEnabled</code> attributes.</p>
<p>The <code>collapsible</code> attribute adds buttons for collapsing and expanding columns to the header. Collapsing is
    also available by double-clicking on the header.</p>
<p>The <code>columnReorderingAllowed</code> attribute allows changing the order of columns using Drag'n'Drop.</p>
<p>The <code>columnActionsEnabled</code> attribute adds a button that opens a dialog menu that allows you to hide,
    expand and collapse columns. The corresponding actions are available in the component's <b>Java API</b>.</p>
<p>All the settings described above are saved in the view settings for the current user if <code>SettingsFacet</code>
    is added. When the view is reopened, the settings are applied again. The user's view settings save the order of
    columns and their state (visibility and collapsed state).</p>
