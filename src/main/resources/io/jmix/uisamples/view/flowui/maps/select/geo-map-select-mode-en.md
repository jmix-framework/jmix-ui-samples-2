Both `DataVectorSource` and `VectorSource` have a selection mode. To enable selection mode, set the `featureSelectEnabled` attribute to `true`. These sources provide:
- Methods for programmatically selecting and deselecting items, which start with `select` and `deselect`.
- A select event to handle user or programmatic item selection.
