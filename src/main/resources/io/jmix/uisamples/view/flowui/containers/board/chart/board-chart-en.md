This example demonstrates how the `Board` component can be used to create an interactive and responsive dashboard.

`Board` component automatically arranges components in a grid layout, ensuring a convenient and consistent display of
information across different devices. This approach simplifies the implementation of analytical panels and overview
views.

The dashboard can include:

- Statistic cards with key metrics
- Charts and graphs
- Data grids
- Text or visual widgets
