<p>
    This sample demonstrates how to add calendar event overlap rules. The overlap function takes two parameters:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>stillEvent</code> - the overlapped event.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>movingEvent</code> - the event that overlaps another one.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Additional properties are placed in the <code>extendedProps</code> property. The property path will be formatted
    into a single property that joins properties with a capitalized first letter.
</p>
