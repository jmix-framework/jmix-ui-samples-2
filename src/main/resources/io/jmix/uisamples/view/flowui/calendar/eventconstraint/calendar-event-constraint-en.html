    The <code>eventConstraintGroupId</code> property sets the name of the group that should be used as a constraint for
    dragging and resizing calendar events. This property works across data providers.
</p>
<p>
    Another way to specify a constraint is to use the <code>eventConstraintBusinessHoursEnabled</code> property. If this
    property is enabled, the component will adhere to the specified business hours as a constraint for calendar event.

    Calendar events that have the same group ID will be moved together.
