This sample demonstrates the autocompletion capability of the `CodeEditor` component. To enable autocompletion based on
the set `CodeEditor` mode use the `defaultSuggestionsEnabled` attribute.

The following keyboards shortcuts are used to open a popup window with default autocompletion suggestions:

- <kbd>‚å•</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> for macOS
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> for Windows

The `CodeEditor` component supports autocompletion while typing. Such autocompletion can be enabled using the
`liveSuggestionsEnabled` property.
