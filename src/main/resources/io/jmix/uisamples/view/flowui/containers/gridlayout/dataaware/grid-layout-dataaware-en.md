The `dataContainer` attribute can be used to bind data to the `gridLayout` component.\
By default, the entity's `instanceName` will be used for rendering. Custom rendering can be configured using [
`renderer`]({contextPath}/sample/grid-layout-renderer).

The `itemsEnum` property is also supported for rendering enumerations.
