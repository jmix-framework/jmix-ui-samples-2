The `gridLayout` component is used to display components in a grid. It is based on the CSS `grid` module.

Components can be added as nested elements in XML markup, or programmatically via the `gridLayout#add` method.

To customize the gap between elements and the minimum column width, you can use the `gap` and
`minColumnWidth` properties. Properties accept CSS values and variables, such as `150px`, `2em` or `var(--lumo-space-m)`.
