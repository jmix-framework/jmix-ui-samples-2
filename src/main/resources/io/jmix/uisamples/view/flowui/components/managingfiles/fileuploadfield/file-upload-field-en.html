    The <code>fileUploadField</code> component provides a user-friendly way to upload files.
    It enables users to select and upload a file, automatically saving the file content as a byte array to a specified entity attribute.
    This feature is particularly useful for handling file data within the application's data model.

    In this implementation, the name of the uploaded file is conveniently displayed next to the upload button.
    This file name doubles as a download link, allowing for easy access and retrieval of the uploaded file.
    Furthermore, it incorporates a "drop zone" with drag-and-drop functionality.
