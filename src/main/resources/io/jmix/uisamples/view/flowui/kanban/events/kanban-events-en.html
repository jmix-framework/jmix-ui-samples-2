<p>The <b>Kanban</b> board component has a certain set of events that are available for listening. To subscribe to them:
    you need to define a listener in the view controller declaratively, or add it using the corresponding method of
    the component.</p>
<p>Some events may contain additional information about the context. For example, the <code>TaskClick</code> event
    contains information about the entity of the task associated with the card that was clicked.</p>
