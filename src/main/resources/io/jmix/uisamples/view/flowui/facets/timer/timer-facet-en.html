<p><b>Timer</b> is a facet (non-visual component) designed to run UI code at specified time intervals.</p>
<p>The timer action is initiated from the browser as a user request and its handler can update UI components. The timer stops working when the view it was created for is closed.</p>

<p>Timers are defined using the <code>timer</code> element. It has the following attributes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>delay</code> - defines timer interval in milliseconds;<br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>autostart</code> - if set to <code>true</code>, the timer starts immediately after the view is opened. By default, the value is <code>false</code>,
        witch means that the timer will start only when its <code>start()</code> method is invoked;
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>repeating</code> - turns on repeated execution of the timer. If the attribute is set to <code>true</code>,
        the timer runs in cycles at equals intervals defined in the <code>delay</code> attribute. Otherwise, the timer runs only once - <code>delay</code> milliseconds after the timer start.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To execute code on timer, subscribe to its <code>TimerActionEvent</code> in the view controller.</p>
