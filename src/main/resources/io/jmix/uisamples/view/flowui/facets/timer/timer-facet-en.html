<p><b>Timer</b> is a facet (non-visual component) designed to run some code at specified time intervals.</p>
<p>The timer works in a thread that handles user interface events, therefore it can update view components.</p>
<p>Timer stops working when a view it was created for is closed.</p>

<p>Timers are described using the <code>timer</code> element. It has the following attributes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>delay</code> - a required attribute;<br/>
        it defines timer interval in milliseconds;
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>autostart</code> - an optional attribute;<br/>
        when it is set to <code>true</code>, timer starts immediately after the view is opened. By default, the value is <code>false</code>,
        witch means that the timer will start only when its <code>start()</code> method is invoked;
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>repeating</code> - an optional attribute, turns on repeated executions of the timer. If the attribute is set to <code>true</code>,
        the timer runs in cycles at equals intervals defined in the <code>delay</code> attribute. Otherwise, the timer runs only once - <code>delay</code> milliseconds after the timer start.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To execute some code on timer, subscribe to its <code>TimerActionEvent</code> in the view controller.</p>
