<p><code>PivotTable</code> supports the addition of new properties derived from existing ones.</p>
<p>In this example we have temperature measurements in Celsius. But we want to see data in Fahrenheit.
To do this we need to complete the next steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Define the name of the derived property.
    </li>
    <li>
        Write a javascript function. Important note: in the function we need to use localized names of the properties.
    </li>
    <li>
        Initialize the <code>DerivedProperties</code> object.
    </li>
</ul>
