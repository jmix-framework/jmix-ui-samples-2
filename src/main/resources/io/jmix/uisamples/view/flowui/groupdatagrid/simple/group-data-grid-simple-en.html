<p>
    <code>GroupDataGrid</code> is a Grid component that supports grouping data items by specific entity properties. The
    component includes <code>GroupDataGridColumn</code>, which displays the grouping and provides a toggler for each
    group. By default, the column header shows a group icon that manages the grouping column when clicked.

<p>
    To perform grouping declaratively, use the <code>groupBy</code> element, which columns will be grouped.
