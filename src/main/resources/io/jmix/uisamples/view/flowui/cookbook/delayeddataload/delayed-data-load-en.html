<p>This example shows how you can delay a costly data loading operation until the user has made the final selection of
    conditions.</p>

<p>Try to select multiple rows in the left data grid displaying orders. The right data grid will be loaded in 2 sec
    after your last selection and will show all items of the selected orders with
    calculated total quantity, grouped by product name.</p>

<p>The example uses a <a href="/ui-samples/sample/timer-facet" target="_blank">timer</a> facet which is restarted on each
    selection change. The data loading is performed when the last timer goes off, that is in 2 sec after the last
    selection change.</p>

<p>The left data grid is linked with a regular collection data container for the <code>Order</code> entity. It is loaded
    by the loader triggered in the <code>BeforeShowEvent</code> event handler.</p>

<p>The right data grid is connected to a key-value container loaded with aggregated data. Its loader is triggered in the
    <code>TimerActionEvent</code> handler.</p>
