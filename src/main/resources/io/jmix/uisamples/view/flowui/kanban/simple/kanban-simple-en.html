<p>The <b>Kanban</b> board is designed to visually display work at various stages of a process using
    cards to represent tasks, and columns to represent each stage of the process. The component is based on the
    <a href="https://www.htmlelements.com/demos/kanban/overview/" target="_blank">Smart HTML Elements - Kanban</a>
    web-component.</p>
<p>Since the component is used to visualize a set of entities, its functionality is somewhat similar to the
    <code>DataGrid</code> component.
    For example, the component can contain actions for creating, editing, and deleting entities.</p>
<p>In addition, the component implements data binding. You can filter data using the <code>GenericFilter</code>
    component. All changes to the data set will be displayed on the <b>Kanban</b> board.</p>
