    The <code>fileStorageUploadField</code> component uploads files to a file storage system.
    It allows users to upload a file and automatically links it to an entity attribute as a <code>FileRef</code> object.
    This functionality enables users to handle file storage and access within the application, with the <code>FileRef</code> serving as a reference to the file's location in the storage system.

    This implementation of <code>fileStorageUploadField</code> includes a "drop zone," allowing files to be uploaded through drag-and-drop action into the specified area.
