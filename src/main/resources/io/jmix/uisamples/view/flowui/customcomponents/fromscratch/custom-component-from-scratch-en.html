<p>This example shows how to build the light/dark theme toggle.</p>

<p>The server-side part of the component is located in <code>ThemeToggle.java</code>. It contains a number of annotations for integration with the client-side part:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>@Tag</code> - specifies the name of the custom HTML element of the web component.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>@JsModule</code> - imports the JavaScript module containing the client-side part of the component.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Client-side events sent as <code>CustomEvent</code> JavaScript objects are declared on the server side using the <code>@DomEvent</code> and <code>@EventData</code> annotations. Also, the component class has a listener registration method for these events. See
 <code>ThemeToggleThemeChangedEvent</code> nested class and <code>addThemeChangeListener()</code> method in <code>ThemeToggle.java</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>theme-toggle.js</code> file located in the <code>frontend/src/component/theme-switcher</code> folder contains the client-side part, which is a web component extending Vaadin's <code>Button</code>.</p>

<p>
    After creating the client-side and server-side parts of the component, it can be used in views by creating an instance of its Java class and adding it to a parent component.
</p>
<p>
    The following steps completely integrate the component into Jmix UI:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create an XSD for the component (see <code>theme-toggle.xsd</code>).</li>
    <li>Implement the component loader (see <code>ThemeToggleLoader.java</code>).</li>
    <li>Register the component and its loader in the application (see <code>ThemeToggleRegistration.java</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Once these steps are completed, the custom component can be used in view XML descriptors. See the <code>theme-toggle-usage.xml</code> file.
