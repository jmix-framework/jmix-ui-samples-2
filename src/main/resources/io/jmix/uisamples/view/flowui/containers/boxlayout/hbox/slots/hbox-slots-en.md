It is possible to align components inside `hbox` using special slots.

There are tree positions in total:

- `Start`
- `Middle`
- `End`

You can add an arbitrary number of components to each of these positions. To do this, you can use the corresponding
methods of `HorizontalLayout` component, or XML markup.
