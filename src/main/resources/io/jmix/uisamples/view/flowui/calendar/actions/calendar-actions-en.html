<p>
    The <code>FullCalendar</code> component generates a set of events. There are two
    events that are generated without specific conditions: <code>DateClickEvent</code> and <code>DatesSetEvent</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <code>DateClickEvent</code> - the event is fired when a day cell or time cell is clicked.
</p>
<p>
    <code>DatesSetEvent</code> - the event is fired after the calendar date range has been initially set or changed in
    some way, and the DOM of the component has been updated. The calendar dates can change any time the user does the
    following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Navigates to next and previous.
    </li>
    <li>
        Switches the display mode.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clicks a navigation link (e.g. week or day).
    </li>
</ul>
