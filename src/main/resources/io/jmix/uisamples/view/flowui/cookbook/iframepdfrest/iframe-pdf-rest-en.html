    This sample demonstrates possible approaches for displaying PDF files from the file storage using the <code>IFrame</code> component and <b>REST API</b>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    This method is convenient if the document is stored in an entity as a <code>FileRef</code>.<br/>
    If your application is configured with a <b>Generic REST API</b> you can simply specify the request address as the source for the <code>IFrame</code> (see <a href="https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/rest/files-api.html" target="_blank">Files API :: Jmix Documentation</a>).<br/>
    Thus, this request will receive a file that will be displayed using standard browser tools in <code>IFrame</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In this example, a custom request controller was configured. See <code>CustomFileDownloadController.java</code>.<br/>
    In order for this type of requests to be processed correctly by the application, it is required to add a special security filter.<br/>
    See <code>CustomRestSecurityConfiguration.java</code>.<br/>

    This source code contains a directive that allows the use of resources if the requests is sent from <code>demo.jmix.io</code>.<br/>
