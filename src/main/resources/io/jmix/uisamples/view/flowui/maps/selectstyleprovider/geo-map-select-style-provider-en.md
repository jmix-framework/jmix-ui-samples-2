The select styles are applied when the user selects geo-objects on a map. The `DataVectorSource` provides the ability to set a select style generator to generate styles for each geo-object on the source.

Note, select styles will be applied when the `featureSelectEnabled` attribute in the data vector source is set to `true`.
