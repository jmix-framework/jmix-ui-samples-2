<p>There are different ways to style the <b>Kanban</b> board component. You can use component properties,
    renderers, and CSS classes to style it.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, the <code>color</code> attribute is defined for the columns. Colors will be applied to the
    headers.</p>
<p>Also, if you define the <code>applyColumnColorToTasks</code> attribute, the column color will be applied to the task
    card style. If the task has its own color, the task color will take precedence over the column color.</p>
