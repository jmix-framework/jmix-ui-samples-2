# Jmix UI Samples

Jmix UI Samples is a web application that demonstrates usage of standard UI components, layouts, dialogs and notifications, as well as techniques of creating custom
UI components.  It has also a "Cookbook" section which is a collection of recipes for solving typical problems related to UI.

The project contains over 150 examples. We recommend browsing the examples online at https://demo.jmix.io/ui-samples. The application provides the hierarchical menu with search, descriptions and source code for each example.

If you want to run this application locally, clone the repository and follow the steps below:

- Make sure JDK 17 is set up on your machine as described in the [documentation](https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/setup.html#jdk).
- Open the terminal in the project folder and execute:
    ```
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
- After the application is started, open http://localhost:8080/ui-samples in your web browser.
